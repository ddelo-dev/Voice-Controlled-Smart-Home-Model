At first this project was supposed to be a speech to text project then it
turned to a voice activate calculator then it turned into what I have now which is the home system
I decided to go and do this because I always wanted a google home and smart light bulb so I won't
have to get up and turn off the light so doing this project was like a nostalgia type of feeling
it was a lot of trial and error I have to use videos and stuff people from previous semesters used
to help them and also I was working on this project myself which means don't have anyone thoughts,
ideas, or opinions but mines I feel like i did pretty good for me at least using python was hard 
because I never really use python before this class so this project taught me a little bit about
python and how much it can really do and also how much Ai and sound recognition is getting cooler
and better as it keeps evolving  one way I could've made this project better is by one putting 
like a hey lights to know if it’s listening or not, add a lcd, and when AI gets better use the 
better version to make everything run fast and smoothly.
